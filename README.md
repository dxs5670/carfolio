## What is carfolio?
Oftentimes buying a car is an incredible expense. Unfortunately, nothing mechanical lasts forever either. Therefore vehicles depreciate an extreme amount the instant they leave the dealership. Unknown factors affect a car’s value in the secondhand market.

The used car market is one of the largest secondhand consumer product markets across the world. The market for used cars continues to gain footing over their new counterparts. Many cars built within the last 10 years simply don’t require upgrading. They are largely the same as what we see being manufactured today. Depreciation is still an issue we face when buying used cars. How can we mitigate the effects of depreciation?

Carfolio is most simply described as a “complete Carfax”. The allusion to the current leader on consumer vehicle history tracking is to point out what this market is currently missing. While many industries and markets have embraced the “data revolution,” documenting the life of cars is something only really done with collectors’ vehicles. Of course, collectable cars are worth exponentially more when they have comprehensive records. This is the idea that prefaces Carfolio: comprehension when considering all of the details on a vehicle.

Vehicle sellers need a better way to track their car to retain its value. In the same breath, vehicle buyers need a more comprehensive history for the cars they purchase to ensure their reliability and security in the investment of a car. 

Carfolio wants to focus on turning all cars to the same model that collectors follow: the more meticulous you are with maintaining your vehicle and documenting its history, the more value you can retain for what was likely one of the largest purchases you have made to date.
